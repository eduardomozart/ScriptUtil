# FusionInventory-Agent-Deploy

## Script VBScript (Visual Basic Script)

This is a slightly modified version from the original ``fusioninventory-agent-deployment.vbs`` script file available at ``contrib\windows`` folder of [fusioninventory\fusioninventory-agent](https://github.com/fusioninventory/fusioninventory-agent) project.

It was modified to add the following features:

1. Run the script elevated (as admin) through ``GetUAC()`` function.
1. Modified the variable ``SetupLocation`` to use a UNC path.
1. Added ``GetSetupLocationNetworkPath()`` and ``RemoveCIFSSetupLocationOpenFileSecurityWarning()`` functions to detect if ``SetupLocation`` variable is into a CIFS (SMB) share and if it's a network share then ``RemoveCIFSSetupLocationOpenFileSecurityWarning()`` function add an exception to not show "Open File" warning when executing the FusionInventory Agent installer through a CIFS (SMB) share.
1. Deploy FusionInventory for GLPI (Server) CA cert to the local computer (``C:\Program Files\FusionInventory-Agent\certs`` directory) through ``DeployFIServerCACert()`` function.
1. Added sub procedure ``CreateDirs`` used by ``DeployFIServerCACert()`` function to create the certs folder several levels deep all in one go, if it doesn't exists.
1. Modified the variable ``SetupOptions`` and appended the following parameters: ``/execmode``, ``/add-firewall-exception``, ``/debug``, ``/installtasks``, ``/no-p2p`` and ``/ca-cert-file``.
1. Added the function ``TaskScheduler()`` to schedule the installation of the agent instead of installing it immediately. The basic problem with updating the agent through a deployment task is the agent will have to uninstall itself while in use, thus throwing some errors. A good method to update the agent without errors is to create a scheduled task that will update the agent to it's latest version. Please see "[Update FusionInventory agent through a deploy task](http://fusioninventory.org/documentation/tasks/updateagentwithdeploytask.html)" for more information.
1. Now you can specify ``/Verbose`` and ``/Force`` arguments from command line to debug or force the FusionInventory Agent installation without editing the script manually.

## Group Policy

Please read "[Déployer l’agent Fusion Inventory par GPO](https://www.it-connect.fr/deployer-lagent-fusion-inventory-par-gpo/)" (French) for instructions on how to configure the FusionInventory Agent using Group Policy.

1. Create the directory ``C:\Windows\SYSVOL\sysvol\[DomainName]\Policies\PolicyDefinitions``.
1. Copy the file "FusionInventory.admx" to ``PolicyDefinitions`` directory.
1. Copy the file "FusionInventory.adml" to ``PolicyDefinitions\en-US`` subdirectory.

Sample GPO configuration:

```
Collect Timeout  180

CA Cert File ..\..\certs\cacert.pem

## ToDo

1. Edit the FusionInventory installation VBS script to include a directory called "FusionInventory-Agent" and copy the entire contents of that directory to the FusionInventory-Agent installation directory (by default ``C:\Program Files\FusionInventory- Agent``) to allow replacing modules on-the-fly.
1. Move the ``DeployCert`` function to the script logic, so that the certificate file is copied only when performing the FusionInventory installation.
1. Edit the FusionInventory GPO with WMI filters so that the GPO does not create the ``HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Wow6432Node\FusionInventory-Agent`` key on Windows 64-bit systems.
